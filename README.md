# Wave Game

Description:
This project was made to help me get an introduction to game design, as well as a better understanding on how classes and inheritance works. It was also used as an exercise in Java so that I may become more familiar with the language. 

How to Install and Run:
This project should be able to run through any IDE, but if there's trouble I used IntelliJ to make this.
