# Wave Game

Description:
This project was made to help me get an introduction to game design, as well as a better understanding on how classes and inheritance works. It was also used as an exercise in Java so that I may become more familiar with the language. 

How to Install and Run:
This project should be able to run through any IDE, but if there's trouble I used IntelliJ to make this.

Credits:
This project was made following the tutorial linked below, there were multiple parts to it so I'll only be linking the first part and the rest should be able to be easily found through this guys channel.
